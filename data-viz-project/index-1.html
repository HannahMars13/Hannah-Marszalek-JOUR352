    <h1>Are Schools Meeting Their Students' Mental Health Needs?</h1>
    <h2>Data regarding the mental health of students and school employees in the US</h2>
    <h3>By Hannah Marszalek</h3>
    <p>I chose to make these graphs to visualize statistics I found in a May 2022 article from The Washington Post. The data was primarily focused on how the pandemic has affected students and school employees as well as what schools across the country have done to aid them.</p>
    <p>The data came from a survey of 830 nationally-representative public K-12 schools that was conducted between April 12 to 26 by the National Center for Education Statistics, part of the federal Education Department.</p>
